# The default behavior of Ansible is not to merge a dictionnary defined in separate places and I prefer to leave that
# as default.
# That's why I need to define the tag in a separate variable from the dictionnary because I want to be able to redefine
# the dictionnary and the tag in separate files, respectively `vault/<env>.yml` and inventories/group_vars/all.yml`.
